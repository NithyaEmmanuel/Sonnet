    <p>
        This is not a book that demands attention.
        It waits.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Midnight Library explores regret without dramatizing it.
        Each alternate life is not an escape,
        but a mirror.
    </p>

    <p>
        What makes this novel worth suggesting
        is its restraint.
        It refuses to tell you how to feel.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is best read slowly,
        when the day has already gone quiet.
    </p>

    <p class="suggested">
        Suggested for: reflective moods, late evenings, slow readers.
